# 📦 Project Description: AI Call Assistant (Inspired by heyrosie.com)

This project is an AI-powered call assistant designed for small businesses.

## 🧠 What it does:

- Receives calls on that number
- Uses AI to transcribe the caller’s voice (STT)
- Processes the conversation with LLMs (e.g., GPT)
- Responds back via text-to-speech (TTS)
- Fully automated secretary experience — like a smart voicemail with conversation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TanStack Router + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Elysia + TRPC
- **Database:** Convex
- **Auth:** Email + Code or Google login
- **AI:** Whisper, OpenAI (LLM), TTS
- **Voice:** Integration with Twilio (or similar)

## 🎯 Goal:
To build a streamlined, privacy-conscious AI call assistant that helps small business owners handle calls automatically with natural, human-like responses.

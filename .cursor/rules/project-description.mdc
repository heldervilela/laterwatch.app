# Project Overview

This is a macOS mini-app to collect and save YouTube/Twitter links for watching later, avoiding browser tab overload.

The project is structured as a **TurboRepo monorepo** with two packages:

## üì¶ `api/`
- Database: **Convex**
- Backend framework: **ElysiaJS**
- API layer: **tRPC**

## üß© `app/`
- Desktop app: **Tauri v2**, built with **Vite** and styled using **TailwindCSS**
- Data fetching: **TanStack Query**
- UI components: **Shadcn**
- Client-side routing: **TanStack Router**

---

# Coding & Comments

- **All code and comments MUST be written in English**, regardless of communication language.
- Use consistent code style across `api/` and `app/`, following your usual TypeScript + Tailwind conventions.
- When referring to ‚Äúthe app‚Äù, ‚Äúthe project‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe application‚Äù, treat it as this specific macOS link-saver.

# Usage Guidelines
